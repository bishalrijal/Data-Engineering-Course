### Getting Started

```bash
cd Week1

# Start the PostgreSQL container
docker compose up -d

# Connect to the database
docker exec -it course_postgres psql -U postgres -d ridedb


# Stop the container when done
docker compose down
```

## Week 2 — String Functions, Normalization & GROUP BY

This week covers three interconnected topics: cleaning messy string data, understanding why table design matters, and seeing how the database executes aggregate queries under the hood.

### Topics

**String Functions** — PostgreSQL functions for cleaning dirty data: `LOWER`, `TRIM`, `REGEXP_REPLACE`, `SPLIT_PART`, `CONCAT`, and more. The cheatsheet shows each function with a real example from the rides dataset.

**Normalization (1NF → 2NF → 3NF)** — Start with one broken flat table that violates every normal form. Step through each fix and watch the schema get cleaner at each stage. Covers partial dependencies, transitive dependencies, and when to extract a new table.

**GROUP BY under the hood** — A step-by-step walkthrough of what PostgreSQL actually does when it executes a GROUP BY: reading rows from disk, hashing each row's key into an in-memory bucket, running aggregate functions once per bucket, then sorting the result with ORDER BY. Covers the HashAggregate vs GroupAggregate plan choice and why casing mismatches silently split one group into two.

### Interactive Resources

| Resource | Link | What it covers |
|----------|------|----------------|
| String Functions Cheatsheet | [Open](https://bishalrijal.github.io/Data-Engineering-Course/Week2/week2_string_functions_cheatsheet.html) | Every key string function with live rides examples |
| Normalization Exercise | [Open](https://bishalrijal.github.io/Data-Engineering-Course/Week2/normalization_exercise.html) | Fix a broken table through 1NF, 2NF, 3NF step by step |
| GROUP BY Walkthrough | [Open](https://bishalrijal.github.io/Data-Engineering-Course/Week2/group_by_under_the_hood.html) | How HashAggregate works internally, phase by phase |

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `week2_string_functions_cheatsheet.html` | Interactive string functions reference |
| `normalization_exercise.html` | Step-by-step normalization walkthrough (1NF → 2NF → 3NF) |
| `group_by_under_the_hood.html` | Interactive GROUP BY internals walkthrough |
| `query_driver.py` | Python script for running queries against the rides database |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies for this week |

### Key Concepts

**Why normalization matters for this dataset** — The `rides` table has `driver_name` stored as free text. If the same driver is entered as `"ramesh shrestha"` and `"Ramesh Shrestha"`, GROUP BY treats them as two separate drivers — because `hash('ramesh shrestha') ≠ hash('Ramesh Shrestha')`. Normalization fixes this by giving each driver a row in a `drivers` table with a numeric `driver_id` as the foreign key in `rides`.

**The normalization → GROUP BY connection** — Once the schema is normalized and `driver_name` lives in exactly one place, aggregate queries become reliable: GROUP BY on `driver_id` (an integer) is unambiguous, and any display name change only requires updating one row.

## Assignment Submission

Assignments are submitted via GitHub Pull Requests — the same workflow used by professional data engineering teams.

### Overall Structure

You maintain a fork of this repository. Each week, you add your SQL file to the correct `submissions/` folder and open a Pull Request. The instructor reviews inline and either requests changes or merges.

```
Instructor repo (upstream)
    └── you fork it → your own copy
        └── add your SQL file → open a Pull Request → instructor reviews
```

---

### One-Time Setup

Do this once at the start of the course.

**1. Fork this repo** — click the **Fork** button on the GitHub repo page.

**2. Clone your fork:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Data-Engineering-Course
cd de-course-assignments
```

**3. Add the instructor repo as `upstream`** so you can pull new assignments each week:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bishalrijal/Data-Engineering-Course
```

---

### Every Week — Submitting Your Work

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest instructions and files from the instructor
git pull upstream main

# 2. Add your SQL file to the correct submissions folder
# File must follow the naming convention: yourname_weekN_queries.sql
# Example: ram_sharma_week1_queries.sql

# 3. Stage and commit
git add week1/submissions/ram_sharma_week1_queries.sql
git commit -m "week1: add Ram Sharma queries"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin main

# 5. Open a Pull Request
# Go to your fork on GitHub → click "Contribute" → "Open Pull Request"
```

---

### Naming Convention

All submission files must follow this format:

```
yourname_weekN_queries.sql
```

Examples:
```
ram_sharma_week1_queries.sql
sita_rai_week2_queries.sql
```

Files that don't follow this convention will be returned without review.

---

### What Happens After You Submit

- The instructor leaves **inline comments** on specific lines in your PR — read them carefully.
- If changes are needed, the PR stays open. Fix the issues, push again, and the instructor will re-review.
- Once approved, your PR is merged and your submission is complete.

---

### PR Template

When you open a Pull Request, fill in the template:

```
Student name:
Week:
Queries completed: (e.g. Q1–Q5, Q7, Q8)
Stretch attempted: Yes / No

Notes for instructor:
(What was difficult, what you're unsure about)
```

---

### Why GitHub?

By the end of this course you will have a portfolio of real work in version control with instructor feedback inline — something you can show in a job interview. Every commit, every PR, and every review comment is timestamped and permanent.
